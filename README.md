# MatrixVectorMultiplication

* This program finds the dot product of two vectors as well as the diagonal and non-diagonal values of a matrix in parallel.

* It is able to do this by executing on a high performance computer cluster. The `.sbatch ` file handles the settings for that system such as number of cores to utilize, size of matrix and vectors, etc.

* The `.txt` file handles the output for the program rather than printing it to the console.

* The `.pdf` contains the dot product errors in a table and graph format. It also contains the matrix information for the diagonals and non-diagonals, `L1` and `L2` are the dimensions of the matrix and the `A` and `B` as well as `Ap` and `Bp` are used to calculate the values within the matrices and vectors.
